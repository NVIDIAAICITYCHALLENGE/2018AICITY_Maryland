# A Semi-Automatic 2D solution for Vehicle Speed Estimation from Monocular Videos

This repository includes the code of our work for the first track of the Nvidia AI City challenge 2018 and aims to tackle the vehicle speed estimation problem using a single camera. 
This work will be presented in the CVPR 2018 Nvidia AI City workshop.
