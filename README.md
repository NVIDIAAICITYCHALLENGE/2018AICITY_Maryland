# A Semi-Automatic 2D solution for Vehicle Speed Estimation from Monocular Videos

This repository contains the code of our work for the track 1, **Vehicle Speed Estimation** of the [Nvidia AI City challenge](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/2018-ai-city-challenge/) workshop in [CVPR 2018](http://cvpr2018.thecvf.com/) and aims to tackle the problem of single camera speed estimation. 

This work was an oral and poster presentation in the CVPR 2018 Nvidia AI City workshop.
