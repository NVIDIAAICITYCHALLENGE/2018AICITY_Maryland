# A Semi-Automatic 2D solution for Vehicle Speed Estimation from Monocular Videos

This repository contains the code of our work for the track 1 (Vehicle Speed Estimation) of the [Nvidia AI City challenge 2018](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/2018-ai-city-challenge/) and aims to tackle this problem using a single camera. Our Paper can be found [here](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018_workshops/papers/w3/Kumar_A_Semi-Automatic_2D_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf).

This work will be presented in the CVPR 2018 Nvidia AI City workshop.
